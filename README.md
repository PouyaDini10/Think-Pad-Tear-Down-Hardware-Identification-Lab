This lab focuses on safely disassembling a Lenovo ThinkPad laptop to identify and understand the internal hardware components. It simulates real-world IT support tasks and helps build foundational hardware skills essential for IT technician roles.



## üõ†Ô∏è Objective

- Safely disassemble a Lenovo ThinkPad laptop
- Identify and document all major internal components
- Understand the purpose and function of each component
- Practice safe handling and reassembly of laptop hardware

## üì¶ Required Tools

- Lenovo ThinkPad (any model)
- Precision screwdriver set (PH0, PH00, Torx if needed)
- Anti-static wrist strap (optional but recommended)
- Clean, static-safe workspace
- Notebook or digital doc for labeling components

## üß™ Step-by-Step Lab Process

### 1. **Preparation**
- Back up any data if the laptop is functional
- Shut down the system and disconnect all cables
- Remove battery (if detachable)


### 2. **Disassembly**

- Remove screws from the bottom panel
- Gently pry open the casing using a plastic spudger or your fingers
- Document each step with photos or notes


Below is a labeled image showing the screw positions on the underside of the Lenovo ThinkPad (Windows 8 Pro model). Use this as a guide for safe and organized disassembly during your hardware tear-down lab.

This annotated image highlights essential internal components of a Lenovo ThinkPad, including the CPU, RAM, storage drive, ports, and cooling system. It serves as a quick reference for understanding laptop hardware layout and supporting IT repair or diagnostic tasks.

### 3. **Identify Hardware Components**

### üîß RAM Removal Procedure

To safely remove the RAM stick, gently press outward on the two metal latches on each side of the module. The RAM will pop up at an angle, allowing you to slide it out carefully without touching the gold contacts. Always ground yourself before handling internal components to avoid static discharge.

| Spec            | Details                         |
|-----------------|----------------------------------|
| **Brand**       | Micron                          |
| **Type**        | DDR3L SO-DIMM                   |
| **Speed**       | 1600 MHz (PC3L-12800)           |
| **Form Factor** | Laptop (SO-DIMM - 204-pin)      |
| **Voltage**     | 1.35V (Low Voltage)             |

> üí° Ideal for lightweight laptops and energy-efficient systems. Compatible with most DDR3L-enabled ThinkPads.

## üíΩ Storage Component

This section documents the storage hardware found in the disassembled Lenovo ThinkPad.

### Step 1: Remove Mounting Screws

Begin by locating and removing the small Phillips-head screws securing the storage drive bracket to the laptop chassis.** These screws are typically found on each side of the bracket and may require a precision screwdriver.
